# Widgets Studio

## How to use:

Visit http://localstudio.good-loop.com

or to run tests:

	node runtest.js

## Motivation

Widgets are critical components used across multiple projects. Testing should be robust enough to give us confidence that code changes will not break them in any way. Performing this testing through e2e tests using puppeteer on each individual website is not ideal. So this is a dedicated site for it.
